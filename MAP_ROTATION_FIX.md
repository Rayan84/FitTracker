# Map Rotation Fix Summary

## Problem
The map rotation was "out of control" due to competing animation systems trying to control the map heading simultaneously.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by two conflicting mechanisms:
1. **Camera prop**: The Map component had a `camera` prop that was constantly updating with the current heading
2. **animateCamera calls**: The `animateToHeading` function was calling `mapRef.current.animateCamera()` to rotate the map

These two systems were fighting each other, causing erratic and uncontrolled rotation behavior.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Conflicting Camera Prop
- Removed the `camera` prop from the Map component
- Now the map only uses `animateCamera()` for controlled rotation updates

### 2. Enhanced Throttling and Filtering
- **Increased magnetometer update interval**: From 2000ms to 3000ms (3 seconds)
- **Increased heading change threshold**: From 10° to 20° to prevent minor fluctuations
- **Added tracking state check**: Magnetometer only processes updates when `isTracking && !isPaused`
- **Enhanced map update throttling**: 
  - Minimum 1 second between map updates
  - Increased heading threshold for map updates to 15°
  - Only update map when actively tracking

### 3. Improved Animation Parameters
- **Slower animation duration**: Increased from 500ms to 800ms for smoother rotation
- **Better state management**: Added checks to prevent updates when not tracking

## Key Changes Made

### In `setupMagnetometer()`:
```javascript
// Before: 2000ms interval, 10° threshold
Magnetometer.setUpdateInterval(2000);
if (minDiff > 10) { ... }

// After: 3000ms interval, 20° threshold, tracking state check
Magnetometer.setUpdateInterval(3000);
if (!isTracking || isPaused) return;
if (minDiff > 20) { ... }
```

### In `animateToHeading()`:
```javascript
// Before: 5° threshold, 500ms animation
if (minDiff > 5) {
  mapRef.current.animateCamera(config, { duration: 500 });
}

// After: 15° threshold, 800ms animation, 1s throttling
if (now - lastMapUpdate.current < 1000) return;
if (minDiff > 15) {
  mapRef.current.animateCamera(config, { duration: 800 });
}
```

### In Map Component:
```javascript
// Before: Conflicting camera prop
<Map camera={{ heading: heading, ... }} />

// After: Clean map without conflicting props
<Map /> // Only uses animateCamera for rotation
```

## Expected Results
- **Stable rotation**: Map should rotate smoothly without jittery or erratic behavior
- **Better performance**: Reduced CPU usage from fewer unnecessary updates
- **Responsive feel**: Still responsive to significant heading changes while filtering out noise
- **Tracking-aware**: Map rotation only occurs during active tracking sessions

## Testing Recommendations
1. Start a workout and observe map rotation behavior
2. Verify rotation only occurs during active tracking
3. Check that rotation stops when workout is paused
4. Confirm smooth, controlled rotation without jitter
5. Test on physical device with magnetometer for real-world validation
