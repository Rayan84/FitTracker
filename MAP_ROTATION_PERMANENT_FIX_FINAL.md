# Map Rotation Permanent Fix - Final Solution

## Problem
The map rotation functionality was being lost after app restarts or when the screen went out of focus and came back. This happened because the magnetometer subscription was not being properly maintained across app lifecycle events.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Single initialization**: Magnetometer was only set up once on component mount
2. **Lost subscriptions**: React Native sensors can lose their subscriptions when the app goes to background/foreground
3. **No health monitoring**: No mechanism to detect when the magnetometer subscription was lost
4. **Dependency issues**: Functions weren't properly wrapped in useCallback causing re-renders

## Permanent Solution Implemented

### 1. Focus-Based Reinitialization
```javascript
useFocusEffect(
  React.useCallback(() => {
    // Check if magnetometer subscription is still active when screen focuses
    if (!magnetometerSubscription.current) {
      console.log('[FOCUS] Magnetometer subscription lost - restarting...');
      setupMagnetometer();
    }
  }, [setupMagnetometer])
);
```

### 2. Periodic Health Check
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const healthCheckInterval = setInterval(() => {
    // Check every 10 seconds if subscription is lost
    if (location && !magnetometerSubscription.current) {
      console.log('[MAGNETOMETER_HEALTH] Subscription lost - restarting...');
      setupMagnetometer();
    }
  }, 10000);
  
  return () => clearInterval(healthCheckInterval);
}, [location, setupMagnetometer]);
```

### 3. Proper useCallback Wrapping
```javascript
const setupMagnetometer = React.useCallback(async () => {
  // Magnetometer setup logic with proper dependencies
}, [heading, location, isPaused, animateToHeading]);

const animateToHeading = React.useCallback((newHeading) => {
  // Map rotation logic with proper dependencies  
}, [location]);
```

### 4. Responsive Settings
- **Update interval**: 500ms (balanced between responsiveness and performance)
- **Heading threshold**: 5° (sensitive enough for smooth rotation)
- **Map update throttle**: 300ms (prevents excessive map updates)
- **Map rotation threshold**: 5° (consistent with heading threshold)

## Key Features of the Fix

### ✅ **Always Active**
- Map rotation works immediately when the screen loads
- No need to start tracking first
- Works as long as location is available and not paused

### ✅ **Survives App Lifecycle**
- Automatically restarts when app comes back from background
- Detects lost subscriptions and reinstates them
- Survives navigation between screens

### ✅ **Self-Healing**
- Periodic health checks every 10 seconds
- Automatic restart when subscription is lost
- Debug logging to monitor status

### ✅ **Performance Optimized**
- Throttled updates to prevent excessive processing
- Reduced logging to prevent console spam
- Proper cleanup on component unmount

## Testing Instructions

1. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Open any activity screen (Running, Walking, Cycling)
   - Rotate your phone - map should rotate immediately
   - No need to start tracking

2. **App Restart Test**:
   - Close the app completely
   - Reopen the app
   - Navigate to an activity screen
   - Rotate phone - map should still rotate

3. **Background/Foreground Test**:
   - Start using the app on an activity screen
   - Put app in background (press home button)
   - Wait 30 seconds
   - Bring app back to foreground
   - Map rotation should still work

4. **Navigation Test**:
   - Navigate between different tabs
   - Return to activity screen
   - Map rotation should still work

## Monitoring

Watch console logs for these messages:
- `[MAGNETOMETER] Listener setup complete` - Initial setup successful
- `[FOCUS] Magnetometer subscription lost - restarting...` - Focus-based restart
- `[MAGNETOMETER_HEALTH] Subscription lost - restarting...` - Health check restart
- `[MAP_ROTATION] ✅ Rotating map from X to Y` - Successful rotation

## Files Modified
- `src/components/ActivityTrackerNew.js` - Main implementation
- Added focus-based reinitialization
- Added periodic health check
- Wrapped functions in useCallback
- Fixed all linting errors

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
The map rotation feature should now work reliably across all app lifecycle events and survive restarts.
