# Fitness Data Retrieval Fix Summary

## Problem
The "Retrieve from Fitness" feature was not working because:
1. The `react-native-health` library doesn't work with Expo Go (requires custom development build)
2. There was a text rendering error in ProfileScreen when user.name was undefined
3. No fallback mechanism for testing in Expo Go

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Expo Go Compatibility
- Modified `HealthKitService.js` to detect when running in Expo Go
- Added mock fitness data for testing purposes
- Graceful degradation when react-native-health is not available

### 2. Mock Data Implementation
- **Mock Workouts**: 3 sample workouts (Running, Walking, Cycling) with realistic data
- **Mock Steps**: Random step count between 5000-10000 for daily testing
- **Mock Heart Rate**: Sample heart rate data points

### 3. Fixed Text Rendering Error
- Fixed ProfileScreen line 537 where `user.name.charAt(0)` could fail if name is undefined
- Changed to `(user.name || 'U').charAt(0)` to provide fallback

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Clear messaging when using Expo Go vs native build
- Informative alerts explaining the difference
- Proper error handling and logging

## How It Works Now

### In Expo Go (Current Setup):
1. User taps "Retrieve from Fitness" button
2. System detects Expo Go environment
3. Shows alert explaining mock data usage
4. Imports 3 mock fitness workouts
5. Displays success message with import count

### In Custom Development Build (Future):
1. User taps "Retrieve from Fitness" button
2. System requests HealthKit permissions
3. Fetches real workout data from iOS Fitness app
4. Imports new workouts (avoids duplicates)
5. Displays success message with actual import count

## Testing Instructions

### Current Testing (Expo Go):
1. Open app in Expo Go on iPhone
2. Go to Profile tab
3. Scroll down to "Retrieve from Fitness" button
4. Tap the button
5. See alert explaining Expo Go mode
6. Confirm and see mock workouts imported
7. Check Activities tab to see imported workouts

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ No crashes or errors
- ✅ Mock data successfully imported
- ✅ Clear user feedback about Expo Go limitations
- ✅ Workouts appear in Activities tab
- ✅ Badge shows "• Fitness (iOS)" source

## Files Modified:
- `src/services/HealthKitService.js` - Added Expo Go detection and mock data
- `src/screens/ProfileScreen.js` - Fixed text rendering error
- All references changed from "Apple Health" to "Fitness (iOS built-in app)"

## Next Steps for Production:
1. Create custom development build with HealthKit entitlements
2. Test with real iOS Fitness data
3. Add more sophisticated mock data if needed
4. Consider adding data export features
