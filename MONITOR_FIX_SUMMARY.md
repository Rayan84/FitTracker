# FitTracker Monitor Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Aggressive Server Restarts**
**Problem:** The original monitor was constantly restarting the Expo server even when it was running fine.
**Solution:** 
- Improved server detection logic to properly check multiple ports (8081, 8082, 8083, 19000, 19001)
- Added delay between restart attempts (minimum 2 minutes)
- Better detection of actual server status vs. process status

### 2. **Better Error Detection**
**Problem:** The monitor wasn't effectively capturing real-time errors from the Expo development server.
**Solution:**
- Created `improved-monitor.ps1` with proper log capture using PowerShell event handlers
- Real-time monitoring of stdout and stderr from Expo processes
- Better error classification and targeted fixes

### 3. **Web Compatibility Issues**
**Problem:** Web bundling was failing due to React Native modules not available in web environment.
**Solution:**
- Auto-detection of web compatibility errors (ErrorUtils, AsyncStorage)
- Automatic creation of web fallback modules
- Proper handling of web-specific bundling issues

## Current Status

âœ… **Working:** The improved monitor (`improved-monitor.ps1`) is now running correctly and:
- Detects Expo server is running on port 8081
- No longer performs unnecessary restarts
- Shows clean statistics with 0 errors and 0 fix attempts
- Monitors continuously without causing issues

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```powershell
# Start the improved monitor
.\start-improved-monitor.bat

# Or manually:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "improved-monitor.ps1" -Verbose
```

### Available Scripts
- `improved-monitor.ps1` - New, better monitoring script
- `start-improved-monitor.bat` - Easy launcher for improved monitor  
- `realtime-monitor.ps1` - Original monitor (updated but still less optimal)
- `test-error-simulation.ps1` - Test different error scenarios

### Monitor Features
- **Real-time log monitoring** - Captures live Expo server output
- **Smart error detection** - Identifies specific error patterns
- **Automatic fixes** for:
  - Web compatibility issues (ErrorUtils, AsyncStorage)
  - Metro bundling problems
  - Port conflicts
  - Dependency issues
- **Non-aggressive behavior** - Only restarts when actually needed
- **Detailed logging** - All fixes logged to `monitor.log`

### Test the Monitor
```powershell
# Simulate different error types to test auto-fixes
.\test-error-simulation.ps1 -ErrorType "web-compatibility"
.\test-error-simulation.ps1 -ErrorType "port-conflict"
.\test-error-simulation.ps1 -ErrorType "metro-bundle"
```

## Recommendations

1. **Use the improved monitor** (`improved-monitor.ps1`) for better reliability
2. **Keep it running** during development to catch and fix issues automatically
3. **Check the log file** (`monitor.log`) to see what fixes were applied
4. **Test different scenarios** using the error simulation script

The monitor process is now working correctly and will properly detect and fix issues without causing unnecessary server restarts.
